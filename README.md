# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration

![Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only assets that was provided in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. I had to create everything else using HTML & CSS!
